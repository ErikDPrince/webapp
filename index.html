    				<h1>London</h1>
    				<p>London is the capital city of Endland. It is the most populous city in the  United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.For a long time, London was a small city. All its people lived inside the walls that were built by the Romans. This area is still called the City of London. There were many villages around the city. Gradually, more people came to live there. Then, step by step, the villages joined together into one huge city.</p>
    				<p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.After the decline of the Roman Empire, few people remained in London. This was partly because of the Anglo-Saxon people of Sub-Roman Britain being primarily agricultural. Once the Romans had gone, trade with Continental Europe dwindled. In the 9th century, more people started living in London again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England until the 12th century.</p>
